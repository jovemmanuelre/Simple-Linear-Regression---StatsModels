### Simple-Linear-Regression---StatsModels

This is the first exercise project that I did in my Data Science course created by 365Careers on Udemy.

I created a simple regression model for a sample real estate dataset using Pandas, Numpy, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries in Python to understand and describe the causal relationship between Price and Size of the real estate properties.
